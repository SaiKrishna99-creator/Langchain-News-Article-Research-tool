# Langchain-News-Article-Research-tool

<p> This  is a real-time news article research tool where you can input article URLs and ask questions to receive relevant insights from the stock market and financial domain. I did this using python along with Langchain, OpenAI API and FAISS for vector database. The concepts involved here were document loaders (here unstructured URL), TextSplitter, Vector database and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).Then to show the model as a POC application, I used streamlit in python. </p>
